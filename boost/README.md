Code snippets and scripts related to the BOOST C++ library.

### boost-ios
- contains scripts to build iOS framework / libraries from a BOOST distribution. Originally written by Peter Goodliffe, but I've modified it here particularly to have it build the libraries that I needed. Filename indicates the BOOST version required for the build to work.
