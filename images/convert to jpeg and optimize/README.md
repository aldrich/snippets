Convert to JPEG and Optimize
---

This is an Automator workflow applet for optimizing the image sizes of JPEG and PNG files. Drag and drop.

Make sure you have ImageOptim installed: http://imageoptim.com/

Copy JPEGify.app to /Applications or /Users/<username>/Applications. Make a shortcut (alias)of it in your desktop by dragging it while holding ⌘⌥ (command-alt). Alternatively you can drag this to your Dock.

Drag a jpeg or png image to JPEGify. The image is transformed to jpeg, and optimized where it is. Make sure you have a backup of this image!
